### Balanced tree
The depth of left and right subtrees of any node diff by 1 or less.

### Complete tree
The binary tree is a binary tree in which each level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

### Symmetric Tree
time complexity: O(n)

### Tweaked Identical Binary Trees

### Is Binary Search Tree Or Not
time complexity: O(n)
space complexity: O(n)
